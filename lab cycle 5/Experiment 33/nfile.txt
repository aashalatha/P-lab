The Himalayan mountains have long been home to indigenous groups living in the valleys. 
The word “Sherpa” is often used to mean mountain guide, though it actually refers to an ethnic group. 
Most climbs of Everest would be impossible without the Sherpas’ logistical help and knowledge. 
Traditionally, their lifestyle has consisted of farming, herding, and trade. 
Mount Everest’s climbing industry has become controversial. 
With more people has also come more pollution up near the summit as climbers often discard unwanted items all along the mountain. 
Sherpa guides are faced with some of the highest death rates of any field of employment, for comparatively little pay.
