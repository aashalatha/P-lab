
The Himalayan mountains have long been home to indigenous groups living in the valleys. 
The most famous of these are the Sherpa people. 
The word “Sherpa” is often used to mean mountain guide, though it actually refers to an ethnic group. 
The Sherpa have valuable experience in mountain climbing, which they can provide to other climbers. 
Most climbs of Everest would be impossible without the Sherpas’ logistical help and knowledge. 
However, their way of life extends beyond helping Everest climbers. 
Traditionally, their lifestyle has consisted of farming, herding, and trade. 
And, because they live at such a high altitude year round, they are accustomed to the low oxygen levels. 
Mount Everest’s climbing industry has become controversial. 
As popularity of the climb has increased, there have been more “traffic jams” as climbers spend too much time in the death zone waiting for their chance to go to the summit. 
With more people has also come more pollution up near the summit as climbers often discard unwanted items all along the mountain. 
Additionally, the Sherpa people have been exploited by climbers, and their traditional way of life has been disrupted by foreign climbers. 
Sherpa guides are faced with some of the highest death rates of any field of employment, for comparatively little pay. 
Most disturbingly, because many climbers have died along the way, and their bodies are impossible to retrieve, climbers must frequently travel past corpses as they make their way up the mountain.
